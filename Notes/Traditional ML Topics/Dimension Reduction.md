# Basic Ideas

`Curse of Dimensionality` indicates incovenience when conducting data mining or machine learning algorithms, thus intrigging us to reduce the dimensions of the datasets. In most of the time, however, dimensional reduction indicates potential loss in information, or relationships between points. To satisfy the goals of:
- Visualization
- Noise reduction
- Feature extraction
- Computational efficiency

We tend to apply different strategies to reduce the dimensions to reach our goals most. To sum up, we have a full workflow for this, which is in short:
- Find the design matrix and target vector (if necessary)
- Figure out the corresponding matrix to conduct dimensional reduction
- Develop ways to reduce loss

[[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]]

[[Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)]]

[[Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)]]

[[Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE, t-SNE, UMAP)]]
