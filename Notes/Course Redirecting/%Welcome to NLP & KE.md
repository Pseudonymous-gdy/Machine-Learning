## Course Overview

This is the course of Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering, basically illustrating how LLM is derived. Basically, it's a fundamental part for further career in big corporations, LLM Labs, etc.

### Why do I choose to put this into Machine Learning Series?

Basically, machine learning series is aimed at introducing machine learning techniques and developments from an undergraduate view, meaning that as a development of machine learning or application of machine learning skills, NLP should be related and included. Also, models like transformers are developed for NLP tasks, which could only be seen if we introduce the topic. Moreover, since nowadays we are increasingly dependent on AI/LLM products, related knowledge might help you learn better from those works.

You might view this course as:
- A way to study NLP and LLM
- A project developed from machine learning and deep learning
