## Course Overview

Deep Learning is a course about <font  color=red><b>Neural Networks</b></font>. Also in this course, the majority is based on projects, which assembles workshops in NeurIPS, ICLR, JMLR, etc. Different with `Statistical Machine Learning` or `Data Mining`, Deep Learning, or Neural Network, offers a completely different architecture on ways to predict. (As for convenience, therefore, Neural Network architecture would be placed to a different folder to `Traditional ML tools`). As a novel architecture and trials, we're stepping into a 'modern' perspective of Machine Learning.

`Neural Network-One Way of Brain Simulation`

Past investigations on cognitive science elaborates existence and functions of neurons, and in this perspective, brain is viewed as a "super" computer with trillions of neurons connected and passing microelectronic messages, and neural network is the attempt people made to try simulating human brain to conduct machine learning tasks.

This course will illustrate neural networks as vital element and elaborate further evolved architecture.
