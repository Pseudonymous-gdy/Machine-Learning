### Course Introduction
This course is first derived from lectures in **DSAA 2011 Machine Learning**, a foundational class that covers the core algorithms of machine learning. The following sections will provide an introduction to key aspects of the course. Furthermore, we plan to include more about other courses, e.g., Deep Learning, etc.

### Notes Directory
The `Notes` directory contains detailed materials that are designed to support your learning journey. Here’s how to make the most of it:
- **Viewing Notes**: Open the notes in [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/). They are formatted specifically for this platform to provide a visual and structured learning experience.
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Pay close attention to the mathematical explanations provided. These are crucial for building a strong foundation for more advanced topics.
- **In-Depth Studies**: If you encounter concepts that are unclear, don’t hesitate to ask questions. The notes include in-depth studies, such as exploring the Generalized Linear Model when learning Logistic Regression, to enhance your understanding.
- **Feedback**: If you notice any issues or errors, please point them out. Your input is essential for improving the notes.

### Project Directory
The `Project` directory showcases a comprehensive study conducted by our group on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This section demonstrates how theoretical knowledge is applied in practical data analysis.

### Development Plan
Our current development plan focuses on the following areas:
- **Redirecting Notes**: We are working on reorganizing the existing notes to make them more accessible.
- **Expanding Content**: We plan to refine and expand the notes to cover more algorithms and provide deeper insights.
- **Project Additions**: We will also be adding more project-related materials and examples to enhance the practical application of the concepts learned.
