# Machine-Learning

This course is derived from lectures in `DSAA 2011 Machine Learning`, a fundamental class on machine learning theories. There are certain parts as the introduction to be mentioned in the following.

## Notes
In the `Notes` directory, you might be expected to:
- Open it in `Obsidian`, as it is written down in Obsidian to help form a graphic and standardized view.
- Learn about certain mathematical explanations. This is the foundation of learning further advanced technologies.
- Question about things you don't understand. Although it is derived from a course, several in-depth studies are also included to have a better understanding, i.e. Generalized Linear Model when understanding Logistic Regression.
- Point out any problem if exists. This might be the key for this note to develop.

## Project
In the `Project` directory, you might view how our group in this course is conducting a full study on a dataset on uci machine learning.

## Development Plan
I'm currently taking the summer course on it, followed by a contest after it. Therefore,
- This directory might have a brief skeleton in August.
- Further content might be involved in the future, i.e., deep learning.
